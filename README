## Jasmine Junit Runner

What's this? Quite simple, it's a custsom Java Junit Runner that allows you to embed Javascript Unit tests (using Jasmine) in your Java-based projects. It fully integrates with your most beloved IDE, your most hated version control system and of course your most needed CI env. 

So let's rephrase:

* Run Javascript (the <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine">Jasmine</a> - behavior driven - way) "specs" in Java
* Talks like a duck-erhm, any other Junit Java test. Just use a custom annotation (see below)
* Executes super-fast. No browser required. Hocus-pocus. (Rhino + Envjs magic)

## What Do I need to do? 

1) Fork this project. 
2) Create some Jasmine specs, place them in some folder.
3) Create a Junit test class, annotate it with @RunWith(JasmineTestRunner.class)
4) Fill in the blanks using @JasmineSuite

## More options

@JasmineSuite allows you to set these options:

* debug: use the built-in Rhino debugger (gives you the chance to set a breakpoint before firing the test suite-
* jsRootDir: the javascript install root dir. Jasmine and other should be installed here (see source)
* sourcesRootDir: your production JS files root dir.
* specs: one or more spec file to run. Default behavior: use java Class name (replaces Test with Spec, see example)
* sources: one or more JS production file which your spec needs (included before specs, d'uh)
* generateSpecRunner: (the HTML output, useful for firefox/firebug debugging etc)
